# Movies Bot Downloader!

I was having problems downloading movies, initially I had problems with ads, then I started to access the source code of the sites, until I saw that it was a repetitive movement, so I decided to automate it.

# Make sure you have installed

- Firefox - here: https://www.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/new/
- Python - here: https://python.org/ 
- Transmission - here https://transmissionbt.com/
or another Client Torrent

# How to use

- Go inside the project folder
- At the command prompt you type **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**
- After the installation is finished, just run in command prompt **`python bot-movies.py`** and download movies.

## Important
**SAY NO TO PIRACY, THIS BOT IS USED FOR STUDY PURPOSES, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MISUSE.**
Windows 10 Tests Only.
It is recommended **NOT** to use the computer when placing the movies to download, because the automation was made to run alone, **after the download is in the Torrent client, you can use the PC at will**.
